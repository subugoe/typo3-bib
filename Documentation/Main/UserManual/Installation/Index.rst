Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The the extension should be installed with the TYPO3 extension
manager. During the installation some database tables will be created
and the list view plugin should appear in the plugin list afterwards.

To actually insert or edit a publication reference it is recommended
to use the frontend editor of the list view plugin.

**A note for admins:**

Pdf text searching has additional software requirements which are
described in the **Administration** section.
